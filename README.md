For this project, I used [D3](https://d3js.org/), JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build an interactive dashboard showing comparisons between poverty, age and significant health risk factors. Each axis is clickable independently, and a ToolTip provides data when each point is hovered over.

To view and interact with the dashboard:

1: Clone repo to your own machine.
2: Launch website using VSC Live Server or other local server of your choice.
