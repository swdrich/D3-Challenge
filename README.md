# D3-Challenge : Data Journalism

![Newspapers](/images/image.jfif)

For this project, I used [D3](https://d3js.org/), JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build an interactive dashboard showing comparisons between poverty, age and significant health risk factors. Each axis is clickable independently, and a ToolTip provides data when each point is hovered over.
