          <p>As we cycle through the risk factors on the left-hand axis and compare them to the number of people at or below the poverty 
            rate per state, we see positive correlations between poverty and a lack of access to health care, smoking rates, and obesity 
            rates. While this chart does not have enough data to indicate a causal relationship, it is not impossible to imagine that 
            poverty could play a key role in all of these factors. Poverty can limit the ability to access affordable healthcare, either
            because premiums are too high, or people don't have transportation or funds to manage chronic conditions effectively. It can also
            contribute to obesity by limiting people's access to healthy options, retail grocery stores with fresh produce, or a lack of time
            and/or facilities to cook health meals. Lastly, people in poverty are more likely to be smokers than the general public,
            and may not have access to the support or medications they need to help them quit.

          <p>Examining these three factors against each state's median population age, we do not see strong correlations between age
            and either healthcare access or obesity. There may be a slight trend for older people to have less healthcare, and a slight
            trend for older people also to be more obese, but neither appear on the surface to be statistically significant. When we 
            examine the population of smokers, however, we see a strong correlation between older Americans being more likely to smoke
            than younger ones. This may be the payoff of several decades of strong anti-smoking public health campaigning directed at
            children, as well as younger adults who did smoke being more likely to be able to quit successfully.

          <p>Finally, looking at the risk factors versus median household income, we see many of the same trends that we saw in the 
            analysis versus state poverty rates. As household income goes up, rates of healthcare access go up, and obesity and smoking
            rates drop significantly. In a country where most health insurance is linked to workers' jobs, it is unsurprising that as 
            median income rises, presumably largely from wages, a larger percent of the population would also be insured. Likewise, having
            better access to health care could lead to better health overall, including lower incidences of obesity and more access to 
            the resources and messaging that would help people quit smoking, or not start smoking to begin with.
